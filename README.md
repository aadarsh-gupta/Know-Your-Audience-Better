<h5>Can we help a politician tailor their speech for the next campaign visit to Minnesota? </h5>


Here, I present an approach to utilize the trending topics (searches made on Google, for example) for customizing and tailoring a campaign speech, such that it targets the right audience and creates the desired impact.  

<h3> <u>Steps </u> </h3>
    
**1. Hot Searches on Google Trends**  
  For a geography on interest, extract the top trending topics through the searches made on Google. This can be fetched by using the Google Trends API (pyTrends) by using a search keyword of interest. The API allows to filter for the Geography as well as the time span you want to search for.

**2. Extract Local Sentiments on Popular political topics**  
  Obtain tweets containing the keywords for these trending searches and extra voter sentiment. This makes use of the Twitter API connenction established using any local or cloud Python installation. A common way to extract tweets from Twitter is using the tweepy library. Here, this API gives access to select the location as well as the time span of tweets made. In the output, we can also extract the person's original location, tweet location, other post and profile attributes, like likes, comments and RTs for better understanding of the tweet's reach and performance. Finally, the user ID obtained from the tweet let's us understand whether the user is popular on Twitter and the popularity could be influential in getting the tweet's performance.

**3. Dashboarding the collected tweets/sentiments**  
  I then look at the extracted data to understand some patterns and hidden trends in the data. This can be achieved in two ways: Using the Data Studio present in the GCP suite, Using a tableau dashboard connected to the data for live refresh. Although I created the pipeline in the GCP environment, I make use of Tableau to visualize the results, simply because it allows to mroe variety in visuals and more comfort in designing viwes.
  
**4. Customization for Maximizing the Opportunity**  
  Through the above analysis, any one can understand the voter's sentiments and views on specific topics and tune the speech as well as campaign to better suit a target geography.
